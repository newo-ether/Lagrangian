## A webpage aim to exploring circular restricted three-body problem based on WebGL
--------------------
Have you ever seen the trajectory of a spaceship in a restricted three-body system?

This webpage helps you to build a comprehensive cognition and giving you a new prespective of the rotating three-body system. Adjust the status vector of the yellow ball which represents the spaceship in the system and see the changes of its trajectory. Wish you have a great fun!
